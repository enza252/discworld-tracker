# Discworld Tracker

I've been reading Discworld. It's awesome. You should read it too.

There's (from what I could find) 41 books in the series, of all different sagas with differing characters and a wholly expansive world to explore. I'd like to keep track of the books that I've read, and in each series. So I made a UI where I can click on "books" and highlight them to be done.

Given time, I'll hook this up to a back-end and a db, use a google login to get a user id and then deploy this somewhere, for people to enjoy too. Why not?
